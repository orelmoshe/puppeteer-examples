# What is Puppeteer?
Puppeteer is a library created for NodeJs which basically gives you the ability to control everything on the Chrome or Chromium browser, with NodeJs.

You can do things like a normal browser would do and a normal human would, for example:

* Open up different pages ( multiple at the same time ).
* Move the mouse and make use of it just like a human would.
* Press the keyboard and type stuff into input boxes.
* Take screenshots programmatically for different situations.
* Generate PDFâ€™s from website pages.
* Automate specific actions for websites.

and many many more things.
